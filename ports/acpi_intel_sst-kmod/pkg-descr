Intel Smart Sound Technology (SST) audio driver for FreeBSD.

Provides analog audio playback and capture on Intel Broadwell-U
and Haswell platforms (e.g., Dell XPS 13 9343) where audio is
routed through the SST DSP rather than standard HDA. Supports
the Realtek RT286/ALC3263 codec over I2S/SSP.

Features:
- DSP firmware loading and IPC (catpt protocol)
- PCM playback and recording via sound(4)
- Speaker protection (HPF, peak limiter, gain staging)
- Parametric EQ with real-time sysctl tuning
- Headphone/microphone jack detection
- Full-duplex operation and S3 suspend/resume
